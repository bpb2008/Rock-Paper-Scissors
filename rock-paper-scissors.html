        <h1>Rock Paper Scissors!</h1>

        <p>Choose "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" to play against the computer! Don't forget: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both you and the computer choose the same character, the game is tied. You will play 5 rounds against the computer in this epic battle.</p>
